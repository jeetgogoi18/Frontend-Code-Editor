# Front-End Code Editor

This is a simple front-end code editor that allows users to write and preview HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the editor.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the editor.
- `editor.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the live updating of the preview.

## Files

### index.html

This file contains the HTML structure of the editor. It includes three textareas for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript input, and an iframe for the output.

### style.css
This file contains the CSS styles for the editor. It defines the layout and appearance of the textareas and output iframe.

### editor.js
This file contains the JavaScript logic for the live updating feature. It listens for changes in the textareas and updates the iframe content accordingly.
